(1) Need to select an algorithm for GPU time domain convolution after precision testing. Some algorithms are off by 2 E-05 in terms of accuracy. The code is currrently in place to do precision testing.
(2) Tweak sequential code to allocate aligned fftw memory at file read time instead of using malloc and copying data
Allow for multi-channel input using de-interleaving/interleaving algorithms
